    <h1>Sudoku Rules</h1>
    <p>Sudoku is a logic-based number placement puzzle. The goal is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids (called "regions" or "boxes") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Each row must contain all numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition.</li>
        <li>Each column must also contain all numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition.</li>
        <li>Each 3x3 subgrid (box) must contain all numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition.</li>
        <li>The initial puzzle may provide some numbers (called "clues"). These numbers cannot be changed.</li>
        <li>Use logic and deduction to fill in the remaining empty cells.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>How to play:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Click on a number to select it, then click on a tile on the board to change that tile to be the selected number.</li>
        <li>If the number shows as black on the board, it is correct, and if it is red it is incorrect.</li>
        <li>The H button is the hint button. Select it and click on a tile on the board to reveal the correct number!</li>
        <li>The eraser button removes a number from a tile.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Remember that Sudoku puzzles have only one unique solution. Happy solving!</p>
