<h2 style="text-align: center;">Bingo Rules</h2>

<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>The objective of Bingo is to be the first player to complete a specific pattern on a Bingo card by marking numbers that are called out by the Bingo caller.</p>

<h3>Starting Position</h3>
<p>Each player receives a Bingo card, which is a 5x5 grid with a free space in the center. Each square contains a unique number. The caller has a set of Bingo balls, each labeled with a number corresponding to the possible numbers on the Bingo cards.</p>

<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>The game begins when the user clicks on the ball drop and announces the number. Players look for the announced number on their cards and mark it if present. The process repeats, with the caller announcing new numbers and players marking their cards accordingly.</p>

<h3>Winning Patterns</h3>
<p>Common winning patterns include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Horizontal Line:</strong> Marking all numbers in a single horizontal row.</li>
    <li><strong>Vertical Line:</strong> Marking all numbers in a single vertical column.</li>
    <li><strong>Diagonal Line:</strong> Marking all numbers in a single diagonal line from one corner to the opposite corner.</li>
    <li><strong>Full House:</strong> Marking all numbers on the card.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Winning the Game</h3>
<p>The game continues until a player completes the specified winning pattern and calls out "Bingo!" The playerâ€™s card is then verified for accuracy. If the card is correctly marked, that player wins the game. If not, the game continues until a valid winner is found.</p>

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>Bingo is largely a game of chance, but players can improve their odds by using multiple cards and paying close attention to the numbers called. Quick recognition and marking can make a difference in close games.</p>
<p>Its simplicity and reliance on luck make Bingo an entertaining and accessible game for players of all ages.</p>
