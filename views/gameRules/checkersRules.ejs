<h2 style="text-align: center;">Checkers Rules</h2>

    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>The objective of checkers is to capture all of your opponent's pieces or to block them so they cannot make any legal moves.</p>

    <h3>Starting Position</h3>
    <p>Each player starts with 12 pieces, typically referred to as "men," which are placed on the dark squares of the checkered gameboard. Players sit opposite each other.</p>

    <h3>Movement</h3>
    <p>Players take turns moving their pieces diagonally forward toward the opponent's side of the board. Men can only move forward diagonally to an adjacent empty square.</p>
    <p>If a player's piece reaches the opponent's back row, it is "crowned" and becomes a "king." Kings can move diagonally both forward and backward.</p>

    <h3>Capturing</h3>
    <p>The primary way to capture an opponent's piece is by "jumping" over it diagonally to an empty square immediately beyond it.</p>
    <p>If a player's piece can make a capture, it must do so, and if there are multiple capture options, the player may choose which one to execute.</p>

    <h3>King's Moves</h3>
    <p>Kings can move diagonally both forward and backward. This allows them to maneuver more freely around the board and capture opponent's pieces in any direction.</p>

    <h3>Winning the Game</h3>
    <p>The game continues until one player captures all of the opponent's pieces or blocks them so they cannot move. If a player is unable to make a legal move, they forfeit the game.</p>

    <h3>Strategy</h3>
    <p>Checkers is a game of strategy, requiring players to anticipate their opponent's moves, plan ahead, and capitalize on opportunities to capture pieces while avoiding being captured themselves.</p>
    <p>It offers a balance of simplicity and depth, making it enjoyable for players of all ages and skill levels.</p>
