<h3>Objective</h3>

<h3>Assembly</h3>
<p>Players typically start by assembling the border of the puzzle, using the straight-edged pieces to form the frame. From there, players work on sections of the image, gradually connecting them to the border and each other.</p>

<h3>Interlocking Pieces</h3>
<p>Puzzle pieces are designed to fit together only when they are correctly positioned. Pieces will interlock smoothly without forcing when they belong together.</p>

<h3>Completing the Puzzle</h3>
<p>The puzzle is complete when all pieces have been correctly assembled, and the full image is clearly displayed without any gaps or misplaced pieces.</p>
