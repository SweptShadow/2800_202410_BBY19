<h2 style="text-align: center;">Chess Rules</h2>
    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>The objective of chess is to checkmate your opponent's king. This means placing the opponent's king under attack in such a way that it has no legal moves to escape the threat of capture.</p>
    
    <h3>Setup</h3>
    <p>Chess is played on an 8x8 grid called a chessboard. Each player starts with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The pieces are placed on the two rows closest to each player.</p>
    
    <h3>Movement</h3>
    <p>Each type of chess piece moves in a specific way:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>King:</strong> Can move one square in any direction.</li>
        <li><strong>Queen:</strong> Can move any number of squares in any direction: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</li>
        <li><strong>Rook:</strong> Can move any number of squares horizontally or vertically.</li>
        <li><strong>Knight:</strong> Moves in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular to that direction.</li>
        <li><strong>Bishop:</strong> Can move any number of squares diagonally.</li>
        <li><strong>Pawn:</strong> Can move forward one square, but on its first move, it has the option to move forward two squares. Pawns capture diagonally.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Special Moves</h3>
    <p>There are a few special moves in chess:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Castling:</strong> A move involving the king and either of the player's rooks. It allows the king to move two squares towards a rook on the player's first rank and that rook to move to the square the king has just crossed over. Castling can only be done if neither the king nor the rook has moved previously, and there are no pieces between them.</li>
        <li><strong>En Passant:</strong> A special pawn capture that can only occur immediately after a pawn moves two squares forward from its starting position and lands next to an opponent's pawn.</li>
        <li><strong>Promotion:</strong> When a pawn reaches the opposite side of the board, it can be promoted to any other piece (except a king).</li>
    </ul>
